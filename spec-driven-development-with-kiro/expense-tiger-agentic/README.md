# Welcome to: Future of Software Engineering with Agentic AI

You're in a cloud-based development environment with **Kiro CLI** pre-installed — an agentic AI tool that enables spec-driven development, context engineering, and human-agent collaboration.

## Getting Started

All the info you need is in the workshop guide. Follow the modules to deploy a real serverless application, walk through specs and steering files, run a full bug fix cycle, and measure productivity impact.

## Step 1: Login to Kiro CLI (Terminal)

1. **Open a terminal** by clicking **Terminal** in the top menu, then **New Terminal**
2. **Type this command** and press Enter:
   ```
   kiro-cli login --use-device-flow
   ```
3. **Select "Use with Builder ID"** when prompted
4. **Follow the device flow authentication process**:
   - Copy the device code shown in the terminal
   - Open the provided URL in your browser (on your local machine)
   - Enter the device code and complete authentication
5. **Return to the terminal** — you should see a success message

## Step 2: Test Kiro CLI

1. **In the terminal, type**:
   ```
   kiro-cli
   ```
2. **When the Kiro prompt appears, type your question**:
   ```
   What is agentic coding, and how is it different from vibe coding?
   ```
3. **Important**: If Kiro asks for permissions, **type `t`** to trust and allow access

## Step 3: Continue with the Workshop Guide

Follow the instructions in the workshop guide. The first hands-on task is deploying the Expense Tiger app in **Part I — Module 1: Foundations**.

## Expense Tiger App

This workspace contains the **Expense Tiger** application — a serverless expense management app built entirely with agentic AI. It serves as the hands-on workload for the workshop labs.

For full app documentation (architecture, deployment, testing, troubleshooting), see [README_EXPENSE_APP.md](README_EXPENSE_APP.md).
